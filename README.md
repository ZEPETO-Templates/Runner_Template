<details><summary> How to create a prefab:</summary> 
Prefabs are a special type of component that allows fully configured GameObjects to be saved in the Project for reuse. These assets can then be shared between scenes, or even other projects without having to be configured again.

1. Open Unity: Launch the Unity editor and open your project.
2. Select an Object: Choose the GameObject in your scene that you want to turn into a prefab. This could be a 3D model, a UI element, or any other GameObject.
3.  Prepare the Object: Ensure that the GameObject is set up the way you want it to appear in the prefab. This includes its position, rotation, scale, and any components attached to it.
4.  Create the Prefab:
      - Select the GameObject in the Hierarchy window.
      -Right-click on the GameObject or go to the top menu and select "GameObject" > "Create Empty" to create an empty GameObject as a parent.
      - Drag the original GameObject into the new empty GameObject to make it a child.
      - Rename the new parent GameObject to something descriptive, like "PrefabName_Prefab" (replace "PrefabName" with your desired name).
5. Save the Prefab: With the new parent GameObject selected, drag it from the Hierarchy window into the Project window. Release the mouse button to create a prefab asset based on the GameObject.
6. Use the Prefab:
To use the prefab in your scene, simply drag it from the Project window into your scene's Hierarchy window or directly into the scene view.
7. Edit the Prefab:
 If you need to make changes to the prefab, you can edit the original GameObject in your scene. Any changes made to the original GameObject will be reflected in all instances of the prefab.
8. Save Changes.
