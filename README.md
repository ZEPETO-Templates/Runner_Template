:wrench: Installation and settings

- If you haven't install the Zepeto World you can check how to do it <a href="https://docs.zepeto.me/studio/reference/installation_and_settings">Here!</a>

- Once you have installed Zepeto, you have to pull this repository and you can do it in 3 ways
  - [Cloning it](#cloning-the-project)
  - [Downloading it](#downloading-the-project)
  - [By Unitypackage](#getting-it-from-the-releases-section)

### Cloning the project

First we go to the [Code] button and click it.

<br><img src = "docs/images/download/01.png" alt = "button code img"></img><br>

Then click on the icon to copy the link of the repository (make sure that you are on the https tab) or copy it manually.

<h3>Block:</h3>

Main prefab block. It contains a script (MoveBlock) that defines its speed and whether it moves or not.

It is also possible to modify their level of difficulty so that the level generator decides to add them according to their configuration.

<br>

<h3>SpawnBlock:</h3>

 It's an empty game object, which goes to the end of the block. It has a Collider Trigger to know when the player has finished passing over it and notify the LevelGenerator to add a new block as well as detect the collision with the end of the level to remove it.

## :point_right: You can easily modify this:

**LevelGenerator:**
This script is responsible for generating the initial state of the level and controlling the generation of new blocks through the use of Block Pools. Contains the public references in a list of block pools, as well as the initial block reference and its generation point.

Additionally, you can adjust how often (in seconds) the level of difficulty of the game and its speed are raised respectively.

<br><img width="700" alt="image" src="./docs/images/LvlMgr.jpg"></img><br>   
<br>

**To modify the difficultyLevelsTimeLimits variable in Unity, you can follow these steps:**
1. Select the LevelGenerator GameObject : Open your Unity project and select the GameObject that contains the script with the difficultyLevelsTimeLimits variable you want to modify.
2. Locate the Script in the Inspector: In the Inspector window, find the component or script that contains the difficultyLevelsTimeLimits variable. Make sure the script is attached to the selected GameObject in the Hierarchy.
3. Expand the Variable: Once you've found the script, you should see the difficultyLevelsTimeLimits variable. It may be in a list.
4. Modify the Values: Click on the difficultyLevelsTimeLimits field to expand it if necessary. You'll see a list of numbered values. You can click on each value to edit it directly in the Inspector.
5. Adjust the Times: Modify the numerical values as needed. These values represent the times when the difficulty level will go up.
6.  Save the Changes.
<br>

**To modify the levelSpeedByDifficulty variable in Unity, you can follow these steps:**
1. Select the LevelGenerator GameObject: Open your Unity project and select the GameObject that contains the script with the levelSpeedByDifficulty variable you want to modify.
2. Locate the Script in the Inspector: In the Inspector window, find the component or script that contains the levelSpeedByDifficulty variable. Make sure the script is attached to the selected GameObject in the Hierarchy.

<br>

**To create new blocks and add them to the blockPools variable, modify existing blocks, or change their order, follow these steps:**
1. Access the Script LevelGenerator.
2.  Define a New Block: To create a new block, define a new prefab or game object that represents your block. This could be a platform, obstacle, or any other element in your game.
3. Add the New Block to the Scene: Drag and drop the new block prefab into your scene to place it where you want it to appear during gameplay.
4. Modify the blockPools Variable: In the Inspector, find the blockPools variable in your script. This variable should be an array or list that holds references to all the block prefabs.
5.  Add the New Block to the blockPools Variable: Click the "+" button in the Inspector next to the blockPools variable to add a new element to the array or list. Drag the new block prefab from the Hierarchy or Project window into the new slot in the blockPools variable.
6.  Modify Existing Blocks: To modify existing blocks, select the block prefab in the Hierarchy or Project window. Make the desired changes to the block's properties, such as its size, color, or behavior.
7. Change the Order of Blocks: To change the order of blocks in the blockPools variable, simply drag and drop the block prefabs within the array or list to rearrange them as needed.
8.  Test Your Changes: Play your game in the Unity Editor to test the new blocks, modifications, and order changes. Adjust as necessary to achieve the desired gameplay experience.
9. Save Your Scene and Project: Once you're satisfied with your changes, save your scene and project in Unity to preserve your modifications.



<h3>UI Prefabs</h3>
You can edit every panel of each part of the game from their own prefab.
You can found them in the project folder.
<br><img src = "docs/images/uiprefabs.png" alt = "uiprefabs img"></img><br><br>

5. To apply the changes to instances of the prefab in your scene, select each instance and click the "Apply" button in the Inspector window.
6. Test your changes in Play mode to ensure they work as expected.
7. If you need to make further modifications, repeat the above steps.
